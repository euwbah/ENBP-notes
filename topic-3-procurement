## Purchasing Organization

### Roles of a purchasing organization:

1. Identify & select vendors
2. Negotiate general conditions of purchase
3. Negotiate pricing

### Three purchasing organization models:

1. Enterprise-level:
	- cross-company-code model
	- one POrg for all CC and plants
	- centralized & corporate

2. Company-level:
	- cross-plant model
	- one POrg per CC

3. Plant-level:
	- plant-specific model
	- one POrg per plant
	- decentralized

**Reference purchasing organization**
: One enterprise-level Ref. POrg for high-level decisions collating company-level &|/ plant-level POrgs
: Usage scenarios:
- to collate multiple lower-level POrg's orders into a single order in the event that buying in a larger quantity would warrant a better price per item
- for sake of contract
- for abstraction's sake

### *vs.* Purchasing Group

A purchasing **group** is the buyer/group of buyers responsible for the execution of the actual purchase, a purchasing **organization** simply decides whether, what, and from where / who to buy.
